# INTRODUCTION
Our project work automates Report Card
Generator & Student Details Management.
Report Card PDF Generator retrieve data stored
from MySql database to Python form. The

secure database, so that the information must
be utilized for a long time. Also, there is no
need to maintain record manually on paper.
[3] To represent data in pictorial form such as
table, graph etc.
[4] To create various kinds of templates for

students details & their marks details.
[6] Create a Graphical User Interface Python
Application to perform CRUD operations.
Students Details and Marks Details can be
create, read, update and delete by this
application.
[7] Create a Python Form to Extract Data from
database & fill it in the template pdf.
[8] User can take printouts of the generated pdf.



# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
Python IDLE :- Python IDLE offers a full-
fledged file editor, which gives you the ability to

this program.
MySQL Database :- MySQL is a Relational
Database Management System (RDBMS)
developed by Oracle that is based on Structured
Query Language (SQL).
PyQt5 :- PyQt is widely used for creating
large-scale GUI-based programs. It gives
programmers the freedom to create GUIs of
their choice. It gives you widgets to create
complex GUIs.
Sublime Text Editor :- Sublime is an
advanced code editor. It is a lightweight, cross-
platform code editor known for its speed, ease
of use, and strong community support.



# CONCLUSION
Report Card PDF Generator & GUI Student
Details CRUD Program, saves times of teachers
and administrators. Improving Teaching
Standards. Complete Student Details
automation. Effortless Marks Management.
Python CRUD Operations in our application
helps to manage the data easily.PyQt5 GUI
helps teachers and administrators to work on
the application very smoothly. MySQL RDBMS
helps to store data securely. Forms are used to
convert the data into information very
effectively. The scopes of our application is very
vast. It can be used not only in schools but also
in colleges and offices etc.



# LIMITATIONS
(A) The limitation of the application is that it
needs more improvement in Students Details
and Marks Details management.
(B) Our Application needs Graph to represent
data with more clarity that will be visually
appealing to the User instead our application
uses Tables to display the information.
(C) Storage Capacity is too small means it
cannot store very large amount of data. Backup
facility needs in future.
(D) The application Code needs much more
queries to make a better software in future.
